### 💡 About the Project

I originally started this project as a medical app for tracking symptoms and collecting health data (you can still see that from the commit history). But as the app grew, I became more and more interested in creating something for mental health and mindfulness, so that’s how Wellnest turned into what it is now 😁
I found a wonderful app called [Day One](https://dayoneapp.com/), which I used a lot for inspiration. While building this, I discovered some new tools and ideas — like how **indexed databases** work for offline-first apps.
