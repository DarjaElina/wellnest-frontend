### üí° About the Project

I originally started building Wellnest as a medical journaling app to help users track symptoms and health data. But as the project evolved, I felt more drawn to creating a space that supports mental wellbeing and mindfulness. It gradually transformed into a softer, more personal tool ‚Äî a calm, responsive, and user-friendly space where people can reflect, feel grounded, and track their emotional journey. Along the way, I deepened my skills as a full-stack developer and explored how technology can support emotional health in thoughtful, accessible ways.
