### Tech Stack

- Framer Motion for smooth animations
- React Hook Form + Zod for robust forms
- React Query and Redux for state management
- React Router for routing

### 🌱 What I Learned
I discovered in-memory/local databases like Dexie, which allow building smooth and responsive user experiences even before syncing with the backend.

One of the biggest technical challenges was syncing data between IndexedDB (used for fast local interaction) and the remote backend.

I also explored and implemented social authentication, including Google Sign-In, which was an exciting area to learn.
